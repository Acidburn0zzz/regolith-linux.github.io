Regolith is a unique desktop environment that ditches the cruft of Windows and Mac knockoffs to provide a productive and beautiful place to get work done. Built on top of Ubuntu and GNOME, Regolith stands on a stable, well-supported, and consistent foundation.

### What Makes Regolith Different

- Provides GNOME's system management features with [i3](https://i3wm.org/)'s productive workflow.
- Enables new users a fast and fun way to try out a [tiling window manager](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/i3-tiling-window-manager).
- Supports [easy customization](/configuring.html) and [ricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) via a consistent [Xresource configuration](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-styles/blob/master/Xresources/root).
- Relies on [Ubuntu's app store](https://snapcraft.io/store) and package repositories for a large, high quality selection of software.
- Delivers a desktop with small set of UI features that can be customized and expanded as needed.
- Ships with an overlay of basic keybindings to navigate over windows, launch apps, and manage your system.

### Get Regolith

Install or test drive Regolith from scratch with the [LiveCD Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/regolith-linux/), or if you already have an existing Ubuntu setup*, simply add it as another desktop session by installing the package `regolith-desktop` from the [Regolith PPA](https://launchpad.net/~kgilmer/+archive/ubuntu/regolith-stable). See the [install page](/install.html) for more details.
