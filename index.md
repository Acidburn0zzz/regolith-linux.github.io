# Regolith Linux

Regolith is a polished, productivity-focused Ubuntu-based Linux distribution. It brings together a trifecta of Ubuntu's ubiquity, i3wm's efficient and productive interface, and Gnome's system configuration features.

## What it Looks Like

Regolith is spartan by design.  It's meant to stay out of your way and prevent distraction whereever possible.

TBD: Screenshots

## How to Get Regolith Linux

Regolith can be installed in two ways.  If you already have an existing Ubuntu setup, Regolith can simply be added as another desktop session by installing the metapackage `regolith-desktop` from the Regolith PPA.  If you'd like to start from scratch, download the Regolith Linux ISO and use the Ubuntu install wizard as you would a stock Ubuntu install.  Both approaches are equivelent, except that the LiveCD install does not contain the default Ubuntu UI.
