Regolith Linux is a distro for people that prefer a spartan interface with polished and consistent system management. It brings together a trifecta of [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)'s ubiquity, [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org/)'s efficient and productive interface, and Gnome's [system configuration](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center) features.
