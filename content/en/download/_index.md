Install or test drive Regolith from scratch with the [LiveCD Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/regolith-linux/), or if you already have an existing Ubuntu setup*, simply add it as another desktop session by installing the package `regolith-desktop` from the [Regolith PPA](https://launchpad.net/~kgilmer/+archive/ubuntu/regolith-stable). See the [install page](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-desktop/wiki/Install-Regolith) for more details.
