In 2016 Apple released a new version of their "pro" laptop line without function keys.  Replacing the keys was a small LCD screen designed to provide dynamic functionality depending on the application.  As one who writes software, I rely heavily on function keys for my day-to-day work.  It seemed like an obvious mistake to me and I assumed Apple would release an updated model with the function keys.  This never happened, and so instead I bought the fastest version of the computer that came with function keys.  Ultimately, the machine proved to be underpowered for my needs and the keyboard in general caused me many typos, taxing my productivity.  I then realized that the price I'd paid a decade earlier, in switching from Windows for professional development to a Mac had been a mistake.  Apple clearly does not consider me and my kind in their focus groups when designing new hardware.  I was stuck in a cul-de-sac.  At this time I began to look at Linux distributions and Linux friendly hardware in earnest.

When working in teams writing software, it's common to visit coworkers at their desks and observe them working. Absentmindedly I'd often marvel of the inefficiency of their desktops, with many windows layered over each other, and big desktop widgets and gizmos that crowded their workspaces.  I myself when working on a Mac would remove as much of the desktop stuff (such as the dock) as possible as I realized that frequent window switching, resizing, and organizing took a significant amount of time.  Additionally, when switching between programs, I'd often lose my train of thought due to some random thing popping up or my inability to find the right window.  At this time I recalled a collegue years ago showing me his work setup with a tiling window manager.  At the time I thought of it as a nerdy fad...too esoteric for real work.  At this point I looked into these things to see if they still existed.  They do!  And they are the perfect antidote for the clutter and ineffciency of the modern "desktop UI".  

A year or so back, I discovered that Youtube hosts a vast array of content for computer nerds such as myself.  Having cut my teeth on programming in the 80's with computers such as the Commodore 64 and Amiga 500, I found many videos of these old machines still in use.  In recalling these times from my childhood and in watching the vidoes, it came to me that the simplicity and accessibility of computers has been lost to layers of sophistication.  Some of it is useful (switching between languages, configuring monitors), and some of it is not (huge icons to launch applications you'll never use, notifications, etc.).  Simply loading a terminal on modern computers takes several clicks, and is typically a poor experience out of the box.  Earlier computers often booted right into a programming environment.  Nothing to do, just have fun!  I wanted to bring this simplicity back to my every day computing experience.

When researching tiling window managers, an initial reaction I had was that they are generally pretty ugly out of the box. Often they are designed by people who care less about asthetics than they do pure functionality.  Of course, it is not difficult to configure these systems to be more pleasant to look at.  For example, I would often visit [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) topics with screenshots of "riced" desktops.  It fascinated me that so many would spend so much time to make amazing, clean, and elegant computing interfaces.  I was hooked.  However, there I had a problem with "ricing": it's all about personal customization.  People would create amazing interfaces, but always custom to their specific system.  I wanted to have a consistent experience on my home PC as well as what I use at the office.  I wanted to be able to update in one place and have all my systems just get the update.  There is a simple way of achiving this; by using a package system.  And so I decided that my rice needed to be packaged so that I could just install easily and consistently.  My day job at the time would allow me to use Linux at work, as long as it was Ubuntu.  It wasn't my distro of choice, but certainly better than using a Mac.  So, I learned how to package my riced configurations as Ubuntu packages.    

The functional regression of the Macintosh for professional work lead me to realize that the value of "it just works" was less than the value of being able to control the interface of my computer as I desired.  The active, vibrant, and innovative ricing community taught me that beautiful and effient computer interfaces can be created by anyone, and that by packaging my customizations in Ubuntu, I could in essence have my cake and eat it to.
